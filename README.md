# TodoList
Todo List allows the user to enter a new todo item on the list as well as deleting any current items. Items can also be clicked on to show that they have been completed, and they can be clicked again in the case that they might have to be done again. The pencil icon removes and adds the text input area where new todos can be added. 

The project can be accessed here: https://pamorales3.github.io/TodoList/
